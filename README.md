# Horiseon 
# Challenge-one code refractor

The goal was to rework the code to increase accessibility. Make the code better optimized for search engines, and display semantic elements.
This project was done to understand how to refract code, and utilize HTML and CSS more efficently. Excess and repetitive code was discarded for more compact lines 
of code. To increase accessability alt attributes were also included with the images. I learned to to increase my effectiveness in coding by combined sections of code that will have the same stylings as well as more HTML elements.
